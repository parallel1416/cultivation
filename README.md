# Cultivation

A 2D cultivation game centered around the mythical tree *Jianmu*.

## About

Cultivation is an immersive 2D game where players navigate through an animated menu, explore a world map, and zoom into the world tree itselfâ€”a massive, vertically scrollable environment filled with secrets and interactive elements.

## Game Flow
